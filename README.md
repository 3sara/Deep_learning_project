# Deep_learning_project
This repository is organized as follows:

- [`data/`](data/): folder containing all dataset of images and weather data
- [`models/`](models/): folder containing all the saved and trained models
- [`plots/`](plots/): folder containing saved plots
- [`utility/`](utility/): folder containing useful notebooks for preprocessing and estraction of images
